Athlete annonymous,"First and above all is the Athlete.\nAnyone can become The Athlete. You can build yourselves day by day. Losing weight or gaining muscles comes as an outcome. The point is to be the fittest that you possibly can be. From a Newbie (NB), to a Novice (NV), to a grit-fit (GF), to a Warrior (WR), to the Athlete Anonymous (AA).\nTwo make a community.\nAthletes Anonymous is by default a community of fitness activists who believe in the power of the group. We all advance by helping and challenging each other. Your name and your level and attendance and your stats are all well known within our community. But on the outside we are all anonymous.\nThree is the charm.\nOur charm is that we train in a playground. We make the workout seem like play, something you will enjoy doing and love challenging others at. We have a climbing wall, a running track, a monkey bar circuit, pole dancing, and a toy-space full of the coolest fitness props. We play games as a training method.",33.896863,35.532064,Beirut,Armenia Street,"Facing Spoiler Center_ Chalhoub building, Next to Tawleh restaurant",96176000435
